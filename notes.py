# 
#  create a robust system that allows users to browse, borrow, return, 
# and explore a collection of books and the use of modules.



#Apply encapsulation principles by defining private attributes and using getters and setters
#  for necessary data access.


#Inheritance and Polymorphism:

#Utilize inheritance to give your books a Genre. Your book class can inherit from the 
# Genre class to gain attributes like genre name, description, and category. 
# Or create book subclasses like FictionBook, NonFictionBook that inherit from the Book class. 


#Modules:

#Organize your code into modules to promote code organization and maintainability. 
# Create separate modules for classes, user interactions, and error handling.

#User Interaction:

#Utilize the input() function within the appropriate menus to enable users to interact
#  with the CLI and select menu options.
#Implement input validation using regular expressions (regex) to ensure the correct 
# formatting of user input.


#Error Handling:

#Implement error handling using try, except, else, and finally 
# blocks to manage potential issues gracefully, such as incorrect user input or file operations.


#GitHub Repository:

#Create a GitHub repository for your project and commit code regularly.
#Maintain a clean and interactive README.md file in your GitHub repository, providing clear instructions on how to run the application and explanations of its features.
#Include a link to your GitHub repository in your project documentation.


#Project Tips
#Begin by designing a class hierarchy that represents the library's structure and entities.
#Test your code iteratively as you implement each feature to identify and address any potential bugs or issues.
#Collaborate with peers, seek assistance, and remember that learning is a collaborative effort.
